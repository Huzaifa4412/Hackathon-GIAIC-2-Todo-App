- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation items passed

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. No clarification questions needed as all requirements were specified clearly in the user's original request and informed defaults were used for remaining details.

**Quality Notes**:
- All 25 functional requirements are specific and testable
- All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 5 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 10 edge cases identified for consideration
- Clear scope boundaries defined in "Out of Scope" section

## Next Steps

The specification is ready for:
- `/sp.plan` - Create implementation plan
- `/sp.tasks` - Generate actionable task breakdown
